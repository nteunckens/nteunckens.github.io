I'm Nic Teunckens. I do SAP-stuff and dabble around in Code ...

### Why the Site name?

Why I called this Site "**ASAP As Possible**" has to do with my profound love and admiration of [Michael Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Scott_(The_Office)) from the TV-Show "[The Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(U.S._TV_series))".
