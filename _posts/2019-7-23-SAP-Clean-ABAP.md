"Clean ABAP" is a nice endeavour by SAP-ABAP enthousiasts to generate a set of recommendations on how to write good, consise and maintainable code. This is obviously derived from the "Clean Code" Book by Robert C. Martin.

The "Clean ABAP" GitHub repository can be accessed here : [link](https://github.com/SAP/styleguides/tree/master/clean-abap/cheat-sheet)

The repository holds a good "Cheat Sheet" and "Golden Rules" as .PDF documents.
