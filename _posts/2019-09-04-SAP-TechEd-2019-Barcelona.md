## Barcelona!

I finally get to go to the SAP Tech-Fest of the year : [SAP TechEd 2019](https://events.sap.com/teched-emea/en/home) from 8 to 10 October in Barcelona.
I hope to get a lot out of the Technical Sessions on SAP related stuff such as "SAP Cloud Platform" (and "ABAP in the Cloud"), "SAP Mobile Services in SAP Cloud", "SAP and GEO-Enablement (related to the SAP HANA DataBase)", ... and much more.

Maybe I'll post my after-thought later in a future BlogPost ...
